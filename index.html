                        <h3>Portfolio Architecture</h3>
                        <p>This portfolio is more than a showcase — it's a reflection of my transition from manual coding to AI-assisted engineering. I now leverage prompt engineering and AI orchestration to scaffold full-stack systems with speed, precision, and architectural consistency.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for lightweight rendering. Angular and React are used in demo projects to showcase dynamic UI capabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Projects span .NET Core APIs, Node.js microservices, and FastAPI endpoints — many scaffolded using AI tools based on BRDs or pseudocode inputs.</li>
                            <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> I use OpenAI and  to interpret business logic, generate modular codebases, and automate repetitive development tasks.</li>
                            <li><strong>CI/CD Pipeline:</strong> Configured GitHub Actions with YAML workflows for build, test, Docker image creation, and registry push. Secrets are managed securely via GitHub Secrets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Dockerized applications for consistent deployment across environments. Compose files manage multi-service orchestration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQL Server and MongoDB are used across projects, with vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate) integrated for AI-powered search and matching.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deployment Strategy:</strong> Projects are staged for deployment via Docker registries and cloud environments. Future iterations will include auto-deploy pipelines and serverless endpoints.</li>
